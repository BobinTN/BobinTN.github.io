# @arcgis/core

A minified, unbuilt version of the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) ES modules.

## Features

For an overview of the SDK, visit the [developer documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/key-features/) site.

You can install this package with [npm](https://npmjs.org/) and then use it directly in a framework such as [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) or [Angular](https://cli.angular.io/). Or, you can also create your own custom builds with a module bundler such as [Webpack](https://webpackjs.org) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org).

The SDK includes [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) type definitions. The `.d.ts` declaration files are bundled with the install.

For more information on using the `next` versions, visit the [feedback-js-api-next](https://github.com/Esri/feedback-js-api-next/blob/main/README.md) repository.

Sample applications can be found at [github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/main/esm-samples).

## Get started

Install the package into your project:

```
npm install @arcgis/core
```

## Configure CSS

Set the CSS to the same version as the installed package. You can verify the installed SDK version by running `npm list @arcgis/core`. If you are working with locally hosted assets skip to the _Manage assets locally_ section.

The first example shows importing CSS for the `latest` SDK version: `4.28.7`:

_index.css_

```css
@import "https://js.arcgis.com/4.28/@arcgis/core/assets/esri/themes/light/main.css";
```

## Working with assets

The default configuration for local builds is for the SDK to automatically pull assets from a CDN at runtime. There is no need for additional configuration. The assets include styles, images, web workers, wasm and localization files. `latest` and `rc` versions of the SDK's assets are hosted on the ArcGIS CDN, while `next` versions use assets hosted on the jsDelivr CDN.

### Manage assets locally

If you need to manage the assets locally, copy them into your project from `/node_modules/@arcgis/core/assets`, and then set `config.assetsPath` to ensure requests for assets are resolved correctly. A simple way to accomplish this is to configure an npm script that runs during your build process. For example, use `cp` on MacOS and Windows PowerShell, or [`xcopy`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/xcopy) on Windows, and configure a script in the package.json to copy the folder.

**Important:** Every time you upgrade the SDK, be sure to recopy the new version of the assets into your project. This ensures the assets and API library stay synchronized.

Here’s a React example:

_package.json_

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cp -R ./node_modules/@arcgis/core/assets ./public/assets && react-scripts start",
    "build": "cp -R ./node_modules/@arcgis/core/assets ./public/assets && react-scripts build"
  }
}
```

_App.js_

```js
import esriConfig from "@arcgis/core/config.js";
esriConfig.assetsPath = "./assets";
```

_index.css_

```css
@import "@arcgis/core/assets/esri/themes/light/main.css";
```

For Angular,  one example is to copy the asset files by configuring the `architect/build/options/assets` section of `angular.json`, for example:

_angular.json_

```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "glob": "**/*",
      "input": "node_modules/@arcgis/core/assets",
      "output": "/assets/"
    }
  ]
}
```

_app.component.ts_

```ts
import esriConfig from "@arcgis/core/config.js";
esriConfig.assetsPath = "./assets";
```

_app.component.css_

Add the following line at the top of the css file:

```css
@import "@arcgis/core/assets/esri/themes/light/main.css";
```

For other installations, consider using this npm script as a starting point:

_package.json_

```json
{
  "script": {
    "copy": "cp -R ./node_modules/@arcgis/core/assets ./dist/assets"
  }
}
```
